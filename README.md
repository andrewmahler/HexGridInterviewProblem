This is a project that I had to create to solve a problem given to me for an interview. The goal was to treat a given hexgrid as a wordsearch (look up 'hex grid word search") and find all combinations of words in that hex grid. Each hexagonal shape in the hexgrid would hold one letter. This required searching all different directions to find all combinations of words. 

Interview.java is the main class, and it uses Solution.java and HexGrid.java to encapsulate needed data to solve the problem
